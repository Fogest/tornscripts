# Torn Scripts

This is a personal collection of scripts that I have either created myself or modified to suit my
own personal needs.
Since I mostly play this on mobile, I tried to adapt them to be as concise and useful as possible
on mobile browsers.

## Current Scripts

**torn-hospital.js**

This script modifies faction pages to be able to revive more efficiently. This script was originally
created by muffenman and help from Pi77Bull.
Some of its features are:
* Change days column to display time in hospital instead
* Move member list to the top of the page (just below faction info)
* Hide faction description
* Hide war information
* Display only online, hospitalized members
** Display only hospitalized members that have a hosp time of 1+ hour

**tornCompany.js**

This script prefills company stock input boxes with calculated values depending on the amount of items
sold for the previous day.
It calculates the ratio of items sold and then fills the values from the available capacity to purchase.

**tornCityFinder.js**

This script surfaces the pinpoint markers and images of items found in the city when zoomed in. It's
functionality is very similar to what DocTorn offers.
