## Contributing

If you ever have ideas or would like to contribute with new scripts or fixes, it is as easy as forking
from the **master** branch and then creating a Pull Request back into it. I will review Pull Requests as
soon as possible to get meaningful changes in.

**While contributing:**
* Try to keep in mind the general population. Scripts should be generic as possible so that anyone who might find it can use it
* Try to test your script on a PC browser and on a Mobile browser
* Create the corresponding documentation inside the docs folder
* Modify the README.md file to add an entry to scripts, pointing to the documentation and adding an install link to it
  * Also add the corresponding badges to indicate if a script is compatible with mobile or not
* Keep versioning in mind, that way it is easier to get updates from userscript managers
